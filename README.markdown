# HomeCtrl

AutoHotkey script to remap CapsLock and Enter to Ctrl, when pressed together with another key. When pressed alone (actually, the criterium is a fast release), CapsLock acts like Escape and Enter is just Enter.

(Yes, the useless CapsLock function is entirely disabled)

On Windows, this is most useful for Emacs users, but maybe there are other use cases.

Please notice that I'm still learning AutoHotkey. The basic code come from [this discussion](https://superuser.com/questions/223831/remap-a-key-depending-on-whether-it-was-pressed-alone-or-not), and this general idea come from [these](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/) [three](http://brettterpstra.com/2012/12/08/a-useful-caps-lock-key/) [posts](http://batsov.com/articles/2012/12/06/emacs-tip-number-7-remap-return-to-control-in-osx/).
